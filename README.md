# Dataset Description

This repository contains a table listing stimulation sites and associated behavioral effects reported in the accompanying publication
(Sukunda et al., in press; Mapping the neural substrates of verbal and sign language: A single-case study using direct electrical stimulation).

## Table Overview

The table provides point-wise information for all stimulation sites described in the paper. Each row corresponds to a single stimulation point.

### Columns

- **Point_number**  
  Unique identifier for each stimulation point, corresponding to the point numbers reported in the manuscript.

- **X_MNI, Y_MNI, Z_MNI**  
  MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute 152) coordinates of the stimulation site, reported in millimeters.

- **Error**  
  Type of error induced by stimulation at the corresponding site, as categorized in the paper.

- **Task**  
  Behavioral or language task during which the stimulation was applied.

## Notes

- Coordinates are reported in MNI space to facilitate comparison with other neuroimaging studies.
- Error classifications and task labels follow the definitions provided in the Methods section of the paper.
- This dataset is intended to support transparency, reproducibility, and secondary analyses.
